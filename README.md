## üìù Brief Information on COVID19


**How dangerous is the virus?**
*There are three parameters to understand in order to assess the magnitude of the risk posed by this novel coronavirus:*

- [x] [Transmission Rate (Ro)](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#repro) - number of newly infected people from a single case
- [x] [Case Fatality Rate (CFR)](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/) - percent of cases that result in death
- [x] Determine whether [asymptomatic transmission](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/#asy) is possible

**How contagious is the Wuhan Coronavirus? (Ro)**
*The attack rate or transmissibility (how rapidly the disease spreads) of a virus is indicated by its reproductive number (Ro, pronounced R-nought or r-zero), which represents the average number of people to which a single infected person will transmit the virus.*

- [x] WHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between `1.4` and `2.5`.
- [x] Other studies have estimated a Ro between `3.6` and `4.0`, and between `2.24` to `3.58`.
- [x] Preliminary studies had estimated Ro to be between `1.5` and `3.5`.
- [x] An outbreak with a reproductive number of below `1` will gradually disappear.
- [x] For comparison, the Ro for the common flu is `1.3` and for SARS it was `2.0`.

**Fatality Rate (case fatality ratio or CFR) of the Wuhan Coronavirus**
*See full details:* [Wuhan Coronavirus Fatality Rate](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/)

*The novel coronavirus' case fatality rate has been estimated at around `2%`, in the WHO press conference held on January 29, 2020 . However, it noted that, without knowing how many were infected, it was too early to be able to put a percentage on the mortality rate figure.*

- [x] A prior estimate had put that number at `3%`.
- [x] Fatality rate can change as a virus can mutate, according to epidemiologists.
- [x] For comparison, the case fatality rate for SARS was `10%`, and for MERS `34%`.

**Incubation Period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear)**
*See full details:* [COVID-19 Coronavirus Incubation Period](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/)

*Symptoms of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) may appear in as few as `2` days or as long as `14` (estimated ranges vary from `2-10` days, `2-14` days, and `10-14` days, [see details](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/)), during which the virus is contagious but the patient does not display any symptom (asymptomatic transmission).*
